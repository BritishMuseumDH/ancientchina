page_one=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">At the beginning of time the world was nothing but a great, swirling, black mass. The skies and the earth were not separated; the sun and the moon were still unformed; the seas and mountains had not taken shape.<br><br>It looked like a great dark murky egg.</font>&page_two=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">In this egg the giant Pan Gu was born. He grew up in the darkness and slept for many thousands of years. When he finally woke up he decided he would create order in the world.</font>&page_three=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">He took an axe in his hands and split the egg apart. The lighter parts in the egg rose up and became the sky, the heavier parts sank down to form the earth. </font>&page_four=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">Pan Gu did not want the sky and earth to crash together again so he stretched as much as he could.  He pushed the sky up with his hands and stamped the earth down with his feet. He stayed like this for many centuries until he was sure the sky and earth were solid enough not to fall together again. </font>&page_five=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">Pan Gu was now very weary and tired. He decided to rest and soon fell asleep. He was so old and tired that he fell into a deeper and deeper sleep.  Slowly he drifted away into death. </font>&page_six=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">When he died something very peculiar happened. His breath turned into the wind and clouds. His voice became thunder. His left eye became the moon and his right eye became the sun. </font>&page_seven=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">The mountains and rivers in the world grew out of his body and limbs. The hairs on his body turned into trees, flowers and plants. Even the ticks that lived on his body turned into the animals and fishes of the earth.</font>&page_eight=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="14">So we have the giant Pan Gu to thank for the world and everything in it.</font>
