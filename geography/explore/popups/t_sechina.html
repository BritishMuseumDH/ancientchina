<h3>South east region</h3>
<p>

The south-east of China is mainly hot and humid with temperatures reaching up to 40&deg;C. It does not really get cold and most of the year it is rainy. On the coast typhoons often occur between July and September. Inland Wuhan is known as one of the furnaces of China because of the temperatures that can be reached in the city. The land is highly populated and farmed. Fishing is a key industry on the coast.
