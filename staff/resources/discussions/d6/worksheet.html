			<div class="subtitle">Discussion:</div>In groups let the children go through the 'Crafts and Artisans - Explore' section.  Assign a different material for each group to investigate or else get all the groups to look at the bronze making process.
			<p>Ask them to think about how many different types of skills are needed by each process.  Remind them that some of the materials also need to be mined.  Get them to list each of the skills needed for the process.</p>
<p>With the whole class discuss if each of the processes needed a lot of people.  What sort of organisation would be needed to keep the process going?</p>
<p>A follow on activity could be to get individuals in each group to draw the different stages of each process.</p>
