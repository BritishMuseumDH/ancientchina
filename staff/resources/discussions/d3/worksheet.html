			Jade was one of the most highly valued materials in Ancient China. It was very strong and tough, and came in many different shades and colours.  Show photographs of different pieces of jade from the website - showing different colours, shapes and finishes. If possible hand around a piece of jade to the children.
<ul><li>
What do they notice about the jade pieces, what does it look like, if you have a piece of jade to show them ask what it feels like.
</li><br></ul>
Now ask them to read the story about the jade bi in the 'Prized Possessions' chapter.
<ul><li>What properties made jade so valuable in ancient China?</li></ul>
Read the poem below.
<ul><li>Why were people told to imitate the qualities of jade?</li>
<li>Can they think of any other sayings that compare people with types of minerals or stone (good as gold, bold as brass, solid as a rock).</li></ul>

<div class="subtitle">Background information:</div>
<br><br>
<em>It is soft, smooth and shining - like intelligence.<br>
Its edges seem sharp but do not cut - like justice.<br>
It hangs to the ground - like humility.<br>
When struck it gives a clear resonant note - like music.<br>
The strains in it are not hidden and add to its beauty - like truthfulness.<br>
It has brightness - like heaven.<br>
Its firm substance is born of the mountains and the waters - like the earth.<br></em>
						<br>Ancient Chinese poem about jade.
