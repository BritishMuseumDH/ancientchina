			<div class="subtitle">Class set-up:</div>Whole group discussion<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</div>Script, pictographic<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Discussion:</div>Discuss why writing is important, emphasizing that writing is a way to communicate information over distance and time, and that writing is a way to record information about business, beliefs and ideas.
<ul><li><em>Why is writing important? How is writing used?</em> <p>Ask pupils how they use writing in their daily lives, and to imagine what life would be like if they did not write things down.</p></li><li><em>How could you communicate information if you did not have a writing system? </em></li></ul>
<p>Discuss different types of information recording systems. Ask pupils to consider how information could be communicated if you did not use a writing system. Explain that some of the characters in Ancient China were pictorial representations. Discuss what the benefits and/or difficulties of a system like that might be. <a href="../../followups/fu9/worksheet.html">Look at 'Writing' follow up activity</a>.  Compare and contrast a picture-based and a writing system.</p>
<ul><li><em>What kind of information could you convey using a picture-based system?</em></li>
<li><em>What kind of information would it be difficult to convey using a picture-based system?</em></li></ul>
<p>Ask pupils to consider other ways that information can be conveyed and 'recorded' such as through stories passed down through generations.</p>

<ul><li><em>How are the details of your own life preserved?</em></ll>
<il><em>How does writing something down change the accuracy of the information you want to preserve?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the benefits and problems with communicating and keeping track of important information through speaking and remembering?</em></li></ul>
