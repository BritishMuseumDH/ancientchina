			<div class="subtitle">Individual project:</div>Discuss the purpose of funerary objects with the class. Then, ask pupils to imagine they are archaeologists studying ancient Chinese burials. Ask them to think about what they can learn about what was important to the ancient Chinese by examining what they buried people with. Have them collect information about funerary objects from the Tombs Explore section using the enquiry grid.  Then, ask them to present what they have learnt in the form of a poster, diagram or book.<p></p>			
			<div class="subtitle">Class project:</div>Ask pupils to collect information in the same manner as outlined above. Then, split the class into groups and ask each group to research one particular type of object they learnt about, such as ritual vessels, coffins or jade. Ask them to present what they have learnt to the class in the form of a poster, book, diagram or paper.<p></p>
<p>Ask pupils to find out how people from other cultures were or are buried. What items are buried with them? How are their ideas about burial similar to, or different from those of the ancient Chinese?</p>
