China is a vast country with many different weather systems. The climates in China range from tropical to high altitude, polar conditions.

<p>A tropical climate is found on Hainan Island. Usually there is a large amount of rainfall during the summer months. Average temperatures are 21&deg;C in the winter to 38&deg;C in the summer. From March to November the weather becomes very hot and humid.</p>

In the South East there is usually a very hot, humid summer with a maximum temperature of 38&deg;C. The winters are mild and drizzly with a minimum temperature of 10&deg;C. The coast is often struck by typhoons between July and September. 

<p>The winters in the North East are exceptionally cold with temperatures as low as -40&deg;C. The summers are hot and dry reaching a maximum temperature of 35&deg;C. There is a similar climate in the southwest. 
</p>
In the central areas winters are short and cold with temperatures falling below zero. Summers are long, hot and humid. Flooding has become a problem in recent years. Wuhan, Nanjing and Chongqing are known as 'the three furnaces' because of the heat in the summer. 

<p>The North West desert and steppe is arid. The region has scorching hot, dry summers with temperatures reaching 45&deg;C in Turfan. Winters can be just as bitter as in the North East, although the average temperature is -10&deg;C.    
</p>
The Tibetan plateau is very dry all year round because of the altitude. Summer days can be warm and reach about 25&deg;C. However, at night it can be bitterly cold and the temperature can fall below zero. Winters are extremely cold with fierce winds making it seem much colder than the average -10&deg;C.
