			<ul><li><em>Why was it important to impress the ancestors with what was written on the bronze vessel?</em></li>
			<li><em>How would the ancestors find out what was written on the bowl?</em></li></ul>			
			<p>Ask the children to think of something good they have done recently or some reward they have received.  Now ask them to write around ten sentences that will tell the ancestors about this.  Remind them that they must show proper respect to the ancestors throughout the piece. </p>
<p>The children can then make papier mache bowls (use something flat-bottomed as the mould for the bowls).  When the bowls are set they can paint them a burnished bronze colour.  Then they should paint the piece of writing they have created onto the inside bottom of the bowl.</p>
<p>They now have their very own inscribed bronze ritual vessel!</p>
