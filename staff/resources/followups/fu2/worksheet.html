			<div class="subtitle">Objectives:</div>To understand the size, scale and geography of China. To be able to measure distances on scaled maps, to understand how physical features are represented on maps. To learn about trade routes and communications in ancient China.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Materials:</div>Various maps of China showing different scales and features, physical, political, etc. Books, wide range of resources on ancient China and the Silk Road.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Class set-up:</div>Whole class discussion, groups or partner work.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</div>Scale, transport.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Activity:</div>If possible introduce the activity by discussing a large map of China, ask the children how big they think China is in comparison to the UK, other places, their town, etc. Try to establish a sense of size and scale. Measure the distance between two selected places on the map and model converting cm into km using the map for the children. They can try this themselves. Discuss ways and modes of transport, how long it would take to travel set distances, on foot, by horse, cart or today by train, plane, etc. The children can use the Geography section to find out about the country.<p></p>
<p>The children can now plan their own journeys from place to place, calculating distance and journey time. They should aim to bear in mind the types of physical obstacles which may slow down their journey.</p>
<p>The children could write imaginary journals, based upon knowledge gleaned from the site and from ideas about what the journey will be like based upon ideas gained from the maps.</p>
