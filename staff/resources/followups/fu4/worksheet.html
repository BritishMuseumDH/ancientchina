				<DIV class="subtitle">	Objectives:
				</DIV>	For the children to demonstrate their understanding of historical events. To re-write events using their own opinions. To write for different audiences.
<P></P>
				<DIV class="subtitle">	Materials:
				</DIV>	Desktop publishing programs, a collection of newspapers and magazines.
<P></P>
				<DIV class="subtitle">	Class set-up:
				</DIV>	Ideally small groups, either creating their own newspaper front pages, or contributing to a whole class newspaper.
<P></P>
				<DIV class="subtitle">	Vocabulary:
				</DIV>	Layout.
<P></P>
				<DIV class="subtitle">	Activity:
				</DIV>	Discuss why newspapers are important
<P></P><ul><li><em>How do newspapers get information?</em></li><li><em>How is the language in newspapers different from other sources such as history books, diaries, etc.?</em></li><BR><li><em>How can you make the account relevant and interesting?</em></li><BR></ul>

<p>The activity could use accounts of archaeological discoveries or the newspapers could be transported back to represent daily life and happenings in ancient China.</p>
<p>The simplest way to control this activity is to use a DTP program like Publisher, where the children can see how much space they have or it can be controlled by the teacher. Using ICT also allows the children to easily correct mistakes and make their work presentable quickly.</p>
<p>The children can include their own drawings of site plans, maps or objects in the finished article.</p>
