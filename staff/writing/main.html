	<td><p>The Challenge presents an opportunity for children to examine some of the symbols that have been found on ancient Chinese objects.  They need to match the ancient symbol with the picture of the object it describes.  All the symbols used in this game are pictographic. However it needs to be stressed to the children that the Chinese writing system is not solely based on pictographic symbols.  They form a very small fraction of Chinese characters.</p>
