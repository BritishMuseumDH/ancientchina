name_0=Jade spearhead&type_0=A&desc_0=My, this is a beautiful weapon. It is a spearhead - I have used one of these many times in battle. Of course this one would be no good in battle - jade is much too precious. However, in the next life it will show what a powerful war leader I was. A very good choice!&name_1=Bronze <i>zun</i>&type_1=B&desc_1=This is a very unusual and beautiful ritual vessel. It looks like it has come from the south of China. It will be very pleasing to the ancestors that I will offer them wine in such an unusual vessel. I will need to perform these ancestor rituals even after I'm dead.&name_2=Ceramic <i>jue</i>&type_2=C&desc_2=Mmmm - I think I  would much prefer something made out of bronze or jade. Bronze and jade are much more precious materials. They properly show my status and role in society.&name_3=Bronze <i>hu</i>&type_3=B
&desc_3=What a wonderful <i>hu</i>. I will serve wine to the ancestors from this vessel. It is very important that I continue to make offerings to my ancestors.  It is made of bronze and is wonderfully decorated. This will show how important I was.&name_4=Bronze axe&type_0=B&desc_4=Ahh - a superb choice. This axe is used at ceremonies and rituals.  It will be used to cut off the heads of people or animals who are being sacrificed to the gods.&name_5=Jade silkworms&type_5=D&desc_5=These are splendid. I love jade. It is so precious, beautiful, and wonderful to touch. The worms are so well carved. Yes, this will be a very good addition to my tomb. Perhaps I will continue to have silk clothes in the afterlife.&name_6=Jade carving of face&type_6=D&desc_6=What a marvellous jade object. This is an antique, probably hundreds of years old. Jade is such a precious stone and so beautiful. This will be a very good addition to my tomb.&name_7=Bronze <i>ding</i>&type_7=B&desc_7=Magnificent. Another object to add to my collection of ritual vessels. It is very important for me to bring my sets of ritual vessels. This vessel is called a <i>ding</i>. I will use it to heat food for the ancestors.&name_8=Jade cormorant&type_8=D&desc_8=Magnificent! What a lovely jade object - it is probably part of a pendant set. Jade is very precious and a great addition to my tomb. At home, I have often watched cormorants as they fish.&name_9=Jade stag&type_9=D&desc_9=My husband has often brought back stags from hunting so this will be a great reminder of those hunting trips.  Jade is a very valuable material. It is luminous and glowing. A very good choice.&name_10=Bronze wine vessels&type_10=B&desc_10=Wonderful. These bronze wine vessels can be used at ancestor rituals. Wine is heated in the vessel with legs using a small fire underneath. The wine is then served warm. It is important to use these fine bronze vessels at rituals, even in the afterlife!&name_11=Bronze knife&type_11=A&desc_11=My! This is a dangerous weapon! The handle is decorated with a dragon. A very good choice indeed. This weapon will show how powerful I was on earth.&name_12=Bronze halberd&type_12=A&desc_12=What a splendid bronze halberd. A weapon made out of bronze like this will symbolise my power and status.&name_13=Ceramic jar&type_13=C&desc_13=Hmmm, I don't think I want this in my tomb.  It looks like a copy of a bronze vessel. However I would much prefer this if it were something made in bronze. Bronze is a much more valuable material.&name_14=Ceramic <i>li</i>&type_14=C&desc_14=This is a <i>li</i>. It is a serving vessel. I think that I need something in a much more precious material. Could you find something in bronze, or jade, perhaps?&intro1=I am one of the king's wives.  We have had three sons and two daughters.  I played a very important role in the army.  I led and planned many battles and wars. Some of these were very successful and we gained great land and wealth.  I also was in charge of many ancestor rituals.<BR><BR>I need a tomb that shows how important my life has been, only the finest objects will do.  <BR><br>I will also need to perform ancestor rituals after my death, so I will need the proper ritual vessels for food and drink.  I might need something that will help me fight battles in the afterlife.&variation=You have done well but I will also need some other types of objects.&wrong= One of the objects is not suitable
