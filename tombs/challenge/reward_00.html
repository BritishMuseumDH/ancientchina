<h3>Shang king's wife</h3>

<p>
A woman like this would have been very unusual.  However, archaeologists have found evidence of one such female military leader.
</p>
<p>
Fu Hao was one of the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/consort.html','cons')">consorts</a> of the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/shang.html','shan')">Shang</a> king, Wu Ding.  She was very unusual in that she played an important role in many battles and wars.  She led military campaigns against neighbouring tribes.
</p>

This animal shaped jug is very similar to<br>
many found in the tomb of Lady Fu Hao.</div>
<p>
The discovery of Fu Hao's tomb was very important as it was the only royal Shang tomb that was found <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/intact.html','inta')">intact</a> at Anyang. Anyang was the site of the last capital of the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/shang_dynasty.html','shan')">Shang dynasty</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over two thousand items were recovered from the tomb, 750 of these were jade objects and 468 were made of bronze.  She also had a large number of weapons in the tomb; this shows her status as a military leader.
