<p>
Chariots were used by the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/aristocracy.html','aris')">aristocracy</a> in battles and for hunting. They became a symbol of rulership.  They were so important in fact that the very wealthy had their chariots (along with their horses and drivers) buried with their owners.
