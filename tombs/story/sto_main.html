<h3>Pleasing the Ancestors</h3>
<p>
In Ancient China people believed that there were a number of gods who had a great deal of power over their lives. They could not talk to these gods directly. The only way that they could ask the gods to bring them good fortune was by going through their ancestors. The ancestors were able to communicate with the gods in the spirit world. They could ask them to bring good luck to their relatives on earth.</p>
<p>Therefore it was very important to make sure that your ancestors were pleased and happy with you. If they became angry they might ask for more bad fortune to be brought to you.</p>
